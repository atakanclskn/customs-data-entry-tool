// FIX: The following reference to Vite's client types was causing a "Cannot find type definition file" error.
// This is likely due to a misconfiguration in the project's TypeScript settings (e.g., in tsconfig.json),
// which is outside the scope of the files that can be edited for this task.
// Commenting out this line is a safe workaround as the application does not seem to use
// the specific client-side APIs that these types provide (e.g., import.meta.env or typed asset imports).
// /// <reference types="vite/client" />
